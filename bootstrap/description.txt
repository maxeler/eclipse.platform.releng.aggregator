These files should only exist in 'master'. They should never differ between BRANCHes, 
since there is a file per branch (or stream) to begin with). 

These go in the BUILD_HOME directory (by export/copy or wget) and they are simply to "get things started",
such as via cronjobs, etc. Such as for Platform builds, in /shared/eclipse/builds.

The bootstrap.sh file is responsible for getting all the other scripts that are required,
from the right BRANCH, and starting a build for that BRANCH.

They should not have to change often ... approximately once per yearly dev. cycle.
