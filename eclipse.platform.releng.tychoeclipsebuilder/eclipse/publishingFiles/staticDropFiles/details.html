              Java development tools, and Plug-in Development Environment, Unit Tests, and even some extra items from other projects
              required by Eclipse (such as Equinox and a few bundles from EMF and Orbit). Please be aware that repositories have
              different retention policies, and restrictions on what types can be updated with what other types. See the wiki's <a
              href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Project_Update_Sites">Update Sites</a> document for details.

        </a>
          <ul>
            <li><p>
                These drops contain the SWT libraries and source for standalone SWT application development. For examples of
                standalone SWT applications refer to the <a href=" http://www.eclipse.org/swt/snippets/">snippets</a> section of the
                SWT Component page.
              </p>
              <p>To run a standalone SWT application, add the swt jar(s) to the classpath and add the directory/folder for the
                SWT JNI library to the java.library.path. For example, if you extract the download below to C:\SWT you would launch
                the HelloWorld application with the following command:</p>
              <p>java -classpath C:\SWT\swt.jar;C:\MyApp\helloworld.jar -Djava.library.path=C:\SWT HelloWorld</p>
              <p>
                <b>Note that if you are running on Eclipse 3.3 or later</b>, you do not need to specify the library path, so you
                would launch the HelloWorld application with the following command:
              </p>
              <p>java -classpath C:\SWT\swt.jar;C:\MyApp\helloworld.jar HelloWorld</p>
              <p>
                To run the standalone SWT examples that are shipped with Eclipse, download them from <a
                  href="index.php#ExamplePlugins">here</a>. Then copy the file
                eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.swt.examples_xxx\swtexamples.jar to C:\SWT. Now you can run the examples that are
                described <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/examples.php">here</a>. For example:
              </p>
              <p>
                cd C:\SWT<br /> java -classpath swt.jar;swtexamples.jar org.eclipse.swt.examples.controlexample.ControlExample

              </p>
              <p>On Linux systems, note that the classpath separator character is a colon, so the equivalent command becomes:</p>
              <p>java -classpath swt.jar:swtexamples.jar org.eclipse.swt.examples.controlexample.ControlExample</p></li>
          </ul></li>
        <li><a name="org.eclipse.releng"> <b> Releng Tools (org.eclipse.releng.tools)</b>
        </a>
          <p>This plug-in provides features that can help committers with the Eclipse development process. It is not intended as
            a "tool to extend", or provide API, etc. It is a simple utility. You can install the tool from the usual Eclipse Project
            repositories, or the zipped repo provided on the download page. Since it uses several "internal" non-API methods, you
            may have to have one that "matches" the version of your development environment.</p>
          <p>Currently, the tool provides two important functions.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Fix Copyrights</b>. In the Resource Perspective Projects context menu. Select one or more projects in the
              Resource Perspective. This action will sanity check the copyright notices in all the *.java and *.properties files. It
              compares the "end dates" with the last time the file was changed. It works with either Git repositories, or CVS.
              Copyrights will be updated automatically where the tool deems appropriate. A copyright.log file will be written to the
              workspace directory noting odd conflicts that need to be looked at and manually confirmed or modified. You will need
              to commit any changes yourself.</li>
            <li><b>Validate Versions Match</b>. Once turned on, in preferences, the bundle version in the MANIFEST.MF file will
              be compared with the artifact version in the pom.xml file. If they "mismatch", then a marker is left in problems view,
              so the incorrect version can be fixed before being committed for a build. Mismatched versions can cause Tycho/Maven
              builds to fail and it is easy to change the version on one spot and forget the other, so all committers are encourage
              to use and turn on this tool.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Older tools for use with CVS: The following tools are for using with CVS map files, and while we have every
            expectation they still work fine, they are not actively used by many committers now that most have moved to use to Git,
            so in theory they might be less stable. If you still have a use for them, that's great, and if you find bugs, we'll
            accept them as valid, but will likely require a high quality patch before much effort is spent on it, since they are a
            low priority for the Eclipse Platform team.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Release</b> to the Team menu. This action will Tag selected projects with the specified version <b>and</b>
              update the appropriate loaded *.map files with the version. The user must have the *.map files loaded in their
              workspace and the use must commit the map file changes to the repository when done.</li>
            <li><b>Load Map Projects </b>to the Team menu. Select one or more *.map file and this action will load the projects
              listed in the *.map file into your workspace. Naturally the versions specified in the *.map file will be loaded.</li>
            <li><b>Tag Map Projects</b> to the Team menu. Select one or more *Map files and this action will tag the projects
              listed in the *Map files with a tag you specify.</li>
            <li><b>Compare with Released</b> to the Compare menu. Compare the selected projects with the versions referenced in
              the currently loaded map files.</li>
            <li><b>Replace with Released</b> to the Replace menu. Replace the selected projects with the versions referenced in
              the currently loaded map files.</li>
