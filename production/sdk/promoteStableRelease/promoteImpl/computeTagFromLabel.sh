# Utility to compute "git tag" from "label" for when we
# promote a milestone or RC. This is for aggregator only.
# Note, normal builds, are promoted with their build id as tag,
# such as I20150202-9899.
# and R-builds are tagged later, using same convention as all the
# other repositories.

# In this case, (milestones, and RC's) we always prefix with "S" for
# sorting consistency, then the build numeric label, with underscores,
# instead of periods. If there is no service field, we assume, and use, "0".
# Finally, anything that follows the numbers, as suffixed with
# _suffix. And, note, we assume something always follows, for this
# routine, such as "M5", "RC1", etc., it is not intended for a
# literal release number, such as "4.5".

# Examples;
#  4.4.2RC3 ==> S4_4_2_RC3
#  4.5M6 ==> S4_5_0_M6

# For production use, DEBUG should be false or undefined.
