# These "previousRelease" variables are primarily used to have a
# stable version of Eclipse, that is used, for example, for it's p2
# director, etc., so that "running the tests" is not actually using
# the "just built" versions.

# version here is "build label" ... in general form, the "middle" of archive name,
# such as  "eclipse-platform-${previousReleaseVersion}-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz
# Also used used in p2 testing?

# This is last segment of last release repo, such as in
#  http://${DOWNLOAD_HOST}/eclipse/updates/${previousReleaseVersion}
# NOTE: I am assuming the "composite" repo is suitable for p2. In theory,
# they might want the simple repo, such as at 4.4/R-4.4.1-201409250400

# Note: API tests needs the _base_ of previous release, and also the previous service release
# Bug 378587 - update releng tests (data) to go work against previous release
# Bug 380033 - temp fix to hard code 'archive.eclipse.org' for now
