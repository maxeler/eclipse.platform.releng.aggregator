          </font>Releases are builds that have been declared major releases by
          the development team - for example &quot;R1.0&quot;. Releases
          are the right builds for people who want to be on a stable,
          tested release, and don't need the latest greatest features
          and improvements. Release builds always have an &quot;R&quot;
          at the beginning of the name i.e. R1.0, R2.0 etc. Non-release
          <font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> builds
            are named according to the date of the build - for example
            20011027 is the build from Oct 27, 2001.</font><br>

          build to stable build by the architecture team after they have
          been used for a few days and deemed reasonably stable. The
          latest stable build is the right build for people who want to
          stay up to date with what is going on in the latest
          development stream, and don't mind putting up with a few
          problems n in order to get the latest greatest features and
          bug fixes. The latest stable build is the one the development
          team likes people to be using, because of the valuable and
          timely feedback. </font></td>

            configuration to indicate that the next integration build
            should take this version of the component. Integration
            builds are built from these stable component versions that
            have been specified by each component team as the best
            version available. Integration builds may be promoted to
            stable builds after a few days of testing. Integration
            builds are built whenever new stable component versions are
            released into the build.</font>

          untested and will almost always have major problems. Many will
          not work at all. These drops are normally only useful to
          developers actually working on the Eclipse Project. Because
          nightly builds are produced in a different way from
          integration builds, bundles from nightly builds should not be

          minor or service release (i.e. R3.7 or R3.7.1) after
